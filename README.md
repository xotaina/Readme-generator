# Project Description
This project is a Node.js-based README generator that utilizes the inquirer package to prompt users in the command line for information about their software application project. It takes in user input to generate sections such as the title, description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, test instructions, project questions, and license type. Additionally, it includes a user's GitHub username and email for contact purposes. The information is then structured and written into a professional README file, enhancing project documentation and user engagement.
